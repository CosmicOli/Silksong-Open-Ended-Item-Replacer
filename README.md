# Silksong-Open-Ended-Item-Replacer
A mod designed to replace most 'checks' with an an open ended request for an item that other mods can respond to.  

This mod is not intended as a great or fully formalised item replacer; it is being made as the more generally accepted and definitely more thought out ItemChanger.Core has not been fully ported to Silksong yet, and I felt it would be fun to try code something together in my free time with a one week deadline.  

Hence though, while I will put some effort into compatibility and reasonable design practices, this project will not bloom into anything comparible to the much more standardised product that the ItemChanger port will soon become.  

Upon functionality being achieved, I likely will not continue to update this, however feel free to report bugs or make pull requests and I'll try have a look.
